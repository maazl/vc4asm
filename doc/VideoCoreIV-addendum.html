    <h1>Addendum to the <a href="https://docs.broadcom.com/docs/support/videocore/VideoCoreIV-AG100-R.pdf">Broadcom
        VideoCore IV documentation</a></h1>
    <h2>Documentation bugs</h2>
    <h3>Section 3: Writing to <tt>r5</tt></h3>
    <p><tt>r5</tt> can be written <em>from the elements 0, 4, 8 and 12</em> for
      each slice <em>or only from element 0</em>, depending on whether you
      write to regfile A or regfile B. vc4asm supports the register names <tt>r5quad</tt>
      and <tt>r5rep</tt> for this purpose. The documentation is wrong, nothing
      is concatenated from low order bytes.</p>
    <h3>Section 3: Table 1: ALU Instruction Fields - set flags</h3>
    <p>The flags are <em>only updated when</em> the corresponding <em>condition
        code evaluates true</em> and the target value is assigned. You may use
      this feature to do boolean operations with the flags.</p>
    <p>Furthermore the flags are <em>only updated from the MUL ALU when the ADD
        ALU executes a <tt>nop</tt></em>. In contrast to the Broadcom
      documetation the condition code <tt>.never</tt> has no effect on the
      behavior.</p>
    <h3>Section 3: Branch Instruction - implicit set flags</h3>
    <p>Unlike the Broadcom documentation suggests the <em>branch instruction is
        able to set the flags</em>. But the <tt>sf</tt> bit is at the same
      location of the instruction word than the <tt>raddr_a</tt> field. So
      every branch instruction with an <i>odd register source</i> will set the
      flags. This is an unwanted side effect since the flags of a PC location
      are normally useless.</p>
    <p>vc4asm reports a warning when a branch instruction is used with an odd
      source register. You can use explicit <tt>.setf</tt> to suppress the
      warning.</p>
    <pre>and.setf -,  elem_num, 1<br>bra      -,  ra1        # implies .setf =&gt; warning<br>mov.ifz  r0, 1<br>...</pre>
    <p>Since a branch target will never be at the physical address 0 the <tt>mov.ifz</tt>
      instruction in the above example will never assign a value.</p>
    <h3>Section 3: Branch Instruction - register source</h3>
    <p>The <em>branch target</em> is taken from <em>SIMD element <b>15</b></em>
      if <tt>reg</tt> is set (rather than element 0). This is wrong at several
      places in the documentation.<br>
      However, this can particularly useful to use a regfile A register as
      branch target and for VPM/VCD setup and concurrently since the latter will
      only use SIMD element 0.</p>
    <h3>Section 3: Branch Instruction - target assignment</h3>
    <p>The assignment of the target register(s) of a branch instruction depends
      on the flags. The target register is only assigned if the branch is
      actually taken. The same applies to the flags if <tt>sf</tt> is true. So
      you may not abuse <tt>brr.never</tt> to load the relocated values of
      labels into a register - what a pity!</p>
    <h3>Section 3: QPU Instruction Set - no inf, nan, denormal support</h3>
    <p>The handling of <tt>Inf</tt> and <tt>NaN</tt> seems to be broken or
      just <em>not implemented</em> in Videocore IV. I.e. <tt>0.0 + NaN = +Inf</tt>.
      In fact it only seems to support something like <tt>NaN</tt> but it uses
      the binary representation of <tt>&plusmn;Inf</tt>. So be careful when
      interacting between the GPU and the ARM core with such numbers.</p>
    <p>There is also no support for denormal numbers. They are just truncated to
      0. Not that uncommon for GPUs.</p>
    <h3>Section 3: Register-Mapped Input/Output - Host Interrupt</h3>
    <p>You need to write a <em>non-zero value</em> to the interrupt register
      otherwise nothing happens. But conditional write access seems to work as
      expected.</p>
    <h3>Section 4: TMU FIFO</h3>
    <p>When using direct memory access the TFREQ FIFO can hold up to 8 slots
      supposedly. It turned out to be <em>unreliable to use more than 4</em> of
      them. Sometimes the first QPU elements receive the result from 4 slots
      ahead in case of TMU cache hits.</p>
    <h3>Section 4: Writing <tt>tmu_noswap</tt></h3>
    <p>When writing <tt>tmu_noswap</tt> only the value of <em>SIMD element 0</em>
      counts. Furthermore any non-zero value will disable TMU swap not just 1.</p>
    <h3>Section 7: QPU Reading and Writing of VPM</h3>
    <p>VPM reads seem to <em>block immediately if the FIFO is empty</em>. No
      undefined data is returned when the reads are made too early.</p>
    <p>Furthermore the <em>VPM read setups cannot be queued</em>. Only if the
      result of the last VPM read setup is fully transferred to the VPM FIFO,
      i.e. there is no more than one value outstanding, a new setup is accepted.<br>
      Example: if you request 2 reads with the first write to <tt>vr_setup</tt>
      and another two reads with the second write, then the second job is
      ignored and you can read only two values without a deadlock. In contrast,
      if you request 1 read by the first setup and 3 by the second one, then
      everything is fine, since the single read of the first setup is
      immediately transferred to the FIFO and the setup is discarded. No delay
      slot instructions are required in the latter case.</p>
    <h3>Table 35: VCD DMA Write (VDW) Stride Setup Format</h3>
    <p>Unlike the documentation suggests the <tt>STRIDE</tt> field is <em>16
        bits wide</em>. Probably just a typo.</p>
    <h3>Section 10: Performance counters</h3>
    <p>The documentation of the <em>V3D_PCTRE</em> register is wrong. <em>You
        need to set </em><em>bit 31</em> (allegedly reserved) to enable
      performance counters at all.</p>
    <h2>Instruction constraints</h2>
    <h3>No conditional write to peripheral registers</h3>
    <p>A write to the TMU retiring register (TMU0_S, TMU1_S) or VPM must not use
      conditional write access. Although the conditional write itself works the
      TMU/VPM fifo is triggered unconditional to process the request with
      undefined data in case the condition is not true.</p>
    <p>You should also not write to the same register from both ALUs with inverse
      condition flags. E.g. <tt>mov.ifz vpm, 0; mov.ifnz vpm, 1</tt> will write
      an undefined value from the MUL ALU. Probably any other peripheral register share the same problem.</p>
    <p>vc4asm warns about this kind of access in verify mode.</p>
    <h3>Distance of branch instructions</h3>
    <p>There must be at least two non branch instructions between every two
      branch instructions. Otherwise no branch is taken or the thread will
      crash. This also applies if the branch conditions are reverse and only one
      of the branches can actually be taken.</p>
    <p>However, you can enqueue the next branch just before the last one is
      taken. Example:</p>
    <pre># r0 contains semaphore number [0..15]<br>mul24 ra31, r0, 3*8<br>nop<br>brr ra31, ra31, r:sacq<br>nop<br>nop<br>bra -, ra31<br>...<br><br>:sacq<br>.rep i, 16<br>nop<br>nop<br>sacq -, i<br>.endr</pre>
    <p>The above code fragment dynamically acquires a semaphore depending on the
      number in the r0 register. This is the shortest possible code fragment to
      do this task.</p>
    <h3>MUL ALU pack modes and I/O register targets</h3>
    <p>The MUL ALU pack modes that write only a single byte are not available
      for I/O register targets. The write only hardware registers cannot write
      slices of a word.</p>
    <h3>Concurrent access to VPM registers</h3>
    <p>While VPM read and VPM write can coexist <em>no</em> other <em>concurrent
        VPM access in one instruction</em> is reliable, especially including the
      <tt>ldtmu</tt> signals.</p>
    <h2>Undocumented features</h2>
    <h3>Section 3: Horizontal vector rotation</h3>
    <p>Both source operands must be from accumulator <tt>r0</tt>..<tt>r3</tt>
      for full vector rotation. But if you choose not to do so the rotation will
      only take place within the slices. I.e. [0,1,2,3, 4,5,6,7, 8,9,10,11,
      12,13,14,15] rotates to [3,0,1,2, 7,4,5,6, 11,8,9,10, 15,12,13,14]. In
      fact all source operands are taken from the current element and only the
      write is rotated within the slice by the lower two bits. This can be
      particularly useful in some cases.</p>
    <p>Furthermore the restriction that the source register of the vector
      rotation must not be written in the previous instruction applies <em>if
        the values are transferred to a lower QPU quad</em> only. Rotations
      within a slice and to higher quad are safe. You may ensure this by an
      appropriate <code>.if<var>cc</var></code> extension, either at the
      previous write or at the rotation instruction itself. Examples:</p>
    <pre>and.setf -, elem_num, 1<br>mov&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; r0, ra0<br>mov.ifz&nbsp; r1, r0&lt;&lt;1<br><br>shr.setf -, elem_num, 1<br>mov.ifc&nbsp; r0, ra0<br>mov&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; r1, r0&lt;&lt;1<br><br>and.setf -, elem_num, 12<br>mov      r0, ra0<br>mov.ifnz r1, r0&gt;&gt;3</pre>
    <h3>Section 3, Table 5: Small immediate values</h3>
    <p>The small immediate codes for vector rotations can also be used as
      additional constants. Well, all of them are redundant with [16..31] but
      this allows you to combine vector rotations with immediate values. vc4asm
      will take care of this.</p>

    <h3>Secret access to previous input values through the NOP register</h3>
    <p><em>Reading</em> one of the <em>NOP registers always returns the last
        value</em> read from the particular register file by the <em>SIMD
        elements 12 to 15</em>. So reading <tt>ra39</tt> returns the last 4
      element values read from register file A repeated for each quad and
      reading <tt>rb39</tt> returns the last 4 element values read from regfile
      B. Small immediate values including vector rotations act as register file
      B read as well. Even access to peripheral registers like <tt>unif</tt>
      will stay there. Branch instructions or load immediate do not change the
      values.</p>
    <p>Of course, this is an undocumented side effect. But it seems not to be
      just a dangling reference to some residual voltage at internal bus lines.
      Even after several seconds the values are stable if the are not overridden
      by other instructions meanwhile.<br>
      See also Figure 2 (QPU Core Pipeline) of the documentation. The input
      values from the register files simply stay at the ALU muxes.</p>
    <h4>Possible applications</h4>
    <p>First of all, this is a kind of <em>vector rotation</em>, because you
      can move values from elements 12 to 15 to lower element numbers this way -
      even by the ADD ALU. Example:</p>
    <pre>read elem_num  # regfile A read<br>mov r0, ra39   # results in [12,13,14,15, 12,13,14,15, 12,13,14,15, 12,13,14,15]</pre>
    <p>Secondly you might <em>access a value read by a previous instruction
        again</em> without the need to store it in an accumulator. This is
      always interesting when you cannot read the value from the same register
      again because either it has been overridden meanwhile or it is a non
      repeatable read from a peripheral register like <tt>unif</tt>. But keep
      in mind that in the latter case it makes an important difference whether
      regfile A or regfile B was used to read the uniform value. So do not use
      the pseudo register <tt>unif</tt> in this case since vc4asm will chose
      freely which register file to use. Example:</p>
    <pre>add ra0, ra32, 8  # read uniform<br>sub rb0, ra39, 8  # read the same uniform again</pre>
    <p>Combine immediate value with signal:</p>
    <pre>add ra0, ra0, 8<br>add ra1, ra1, rb39;  ldtmu0  # adds immediate value 8 to ra1 too</pre>
    <h3><a id="mnop" name="mnop"></a>Secret access to previous MUL ALU result</h3>
    <p>Using the <em>MUL ALU opcode 0 in conjunction with <tt>waddr_mul</tt></em>
      let you access the last result of the MUL ALU again. Because of the
      virtual parallelism of the quads only the results from the last quads,
      i.e. <em>only SIMD element 12..15</em> are available. But be careful, if
      the value has not been assigned because of an <tt>.if</tt> condition the
      result is unreliable.</p>
    <p>vc4asm supports the special instruction <tt>mnop</tt> to explicitly use
      the <tt>nop</tt> instruction of the MUL ALU. Example:</p>
    <pre>ldi.setf r0, [0,1,2,3, 1,2,3,0, 2,3,0,1, 3,0,1,2]<br>nop;  v8adds vpm, elem_num, r0  # results in [ 0, 2, 4, 6,  5, 7, 9, 7, 10,12,10,12, 15,13,15,17]<br>nop;  mnop r2                   # results in [15,13,15,17, 15,13,15,17, 15,13,15,17, 15,13,15,17]</pre>

      between.</p>
